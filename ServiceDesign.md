# Ticketing System: Service Responsibilities Document

## 1. Overview
This document defines the purpose, responsibilities, and scope of each microservice in the Ticketing System project. It ensures clarity in service boundaries, outlines the expected interactions between services, and promotes adherence to a microservices architecture.

---

## 2. Services Overview
The Ticketing System consists of the following microservices:

1. **Identity Management Service**
2. **Open Tickets Service**
3. **Ticket Log Service**
4. **Notification Service**
5. **Logging Service**

## 3. Service Responsibilities

### 3.1 Identity Management Service
**Purpose:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and role management.

**Responsibilities:**
- User management:
  - Create, update, and delete user accounts.
  - Reset passwords.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Define and assign roles (e.g., Regular User, Admin).
  - Validate user permissions for various actions.
- Department and organizational structure management:
  - Create, update, and delete departments.
  - Manage departmental hierarchies.

**Inter-Service Interactions:**
- Authenticate users for all services via token validation.
- Provide role and user details to other services (e.g., Open Tickets Service).

---

### 3.2 Open Tickets Service
**Purpose:** Manages live ticket workflows and enforces SLA (Service Level Agreement) rules.

**Responsibilities:**
- Ticket creation, assignment, and escalation:
  - Allow users to create new tickets.
  - Assign tickets to users or departments.
  - Handle escalations based on SLA violations.
- Ticket status tracking:
  - Track progress (e.g., Open, In Progress, Escalated, Resolved).
- Department-based ticket views and management.

**Inter-Service Interactions:**
- Request user and role validation from the Identity Management Service.
- Notify the Notification Service about ticket events (e.g., new ticket creation).
- Log ticket activity in the Logging Service.

---

### 3.3 Ticket Log Service
**Purpose:** Provides long-term storage for closed tickets and supports historical queries.

**Responsibilities:**
- Archive closed tickets for long-term storage.
- Enable advanced querying of ticket histories for reporting and auditing purposes.
- Manage efficient retrieval of archived tickets.

**Inter-Service Interactions:**
- Receive ticket closure data from the Open Tickets Service.
- Provide archived ticket data to other services (e.g., for generating admin reports).

---

### 3.4 Notification Service
**Purpose:** Sends notifications to users about ticket-related events.

**Responsibilities:**
- Notify users about:
  - New ticket assignments.
  - SLA violations and escalations.
  - Status changes (e.g., Resolved).
- Manage user notification preferences (e.g., email, SMS).

**Inter-Service Interactions:**
- Subscribe to events from the Open Tickets Service (e.g., ticket assignment changes).
- Notify users based on data provided by the Identity Management Service.

---

### 3.5 Logging Service
**Purpose:** Provides a centralized system for recording and auditing application events.

**Responsibilities:**
- Log key events, such as:
  - User actions (e.g., account creation, deletion).
  - Ticket lifecycle changes (e.g., status updates).
  - System-level events (e.g., errors, escalations).
- Support querying for logs, ensuring compliance with auditing requirements.

**Inter-Service Interactions:**
- Receive log data from all other services.
- Provide log data to admins via the Identity Management Service.

---

## 4. Future Considerations
1. **Service Scalability:**
   - Each service should support horizontal scaling to handle increased user and ticket volumes.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Implement an event bus (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for more efficient inter-service communication.
3. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
   - Integrate a monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track service health and performance.
4. **Advanced Reporting:**
   - Extend the Ticket Log Service to generate custom reports for admins and stakeholders.
